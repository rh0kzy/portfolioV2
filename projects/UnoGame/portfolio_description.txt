                    UNO GAME - PORTFOLIO PROJECT
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
A fully functional digital implementation of the classic UNO card game, built in Java with a custom GUI framework. This project demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming principles, custom UI development, and game logic implementation.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
-------------------------
• Language: Java (using Java Modules system)
• Architecture: Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
• GUI: Custom-built framework wrapping Java Swing components
• Game Logic: Full UNO game rules implementation
• Players: 1 Human player + 1-3 Computer players (AI)
• Localization: French language interface

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
------------------------
✓ Complete UNO card deck (108 cards):
  - Number cards (0-9) in all 4 colors
  - Action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two)
  - Wild cards (Wild, Wild Draw Four)

✓ Full Game Mechanics:
  - Turn-based gameplay with direction changes
  - Card matching rules (color/number/action)
  - Special card effects (skip, reverse, draw cards)
  - UNO call system with penalties
  - Win condition detection

✓ Intelligent Computer Players:
  - Strategic card selection algorithm
  - Automatic UNO calling
  - Color preference based on hand composition

✓ Interactive GUI:
  - Visual card representation with PNG images
  - Click-to-play card selection
  - Real-time game state updates
  - Color selection for wild cards
  - Player hand display and opponent info

ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS:
-----------------------

1. CUSTOM GUI FRAMEWORK:
   • Created reusable UI components (GFrame, GPanel, GButton, GLabel)
   • Custom layout managers (GBorderLayout, GFlowLayout)
   • Component wrapper system for consistent styling
   • Event-driven architecture with listeners

2. GAME MODEL:
   • Abstract Card class with specialized implementations
   • Player hierarchy (Human vs Computer behavior)
   • Game state management with Observer pattern
   • Deck management with shuffling and card dealing

3. MODULAR DESIGN:
   • Java Module system implementation (module-info.java)
   • Clean package organization by functionality
   • Separation of concerns (Model/View/Controller)
   • Extensible architecture for future enhancements

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
----------------------
• Object-Oriented Design: Extensive use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
• Design Patterns: MVC, Observer, Factory patterns implementation
• Event Handling: Custom event system for game state changes
• Resource Management: Dynamic image loading with fallback mechanisms
• Error Handling: Robust exception handling and validation
• Code Organization: Clean, documented, and maintainable codebase

CODE QUALITY FEATURES:
---------------------
• Comprehensive documentation and comments
• Consistent naming conventions
• Proper exception handling
• Input validation and error prevention
• Memory-efficient design
• Scalable architecture

USER EXPERIENCE:
---------------
• Intuitive click-based interface
• Visual feedback for game actions
• Clear status messages and game state display
• Responsive design that adapts to window resizing
• Smooth gameplay with real-time updates

DEMONSTRATED SKILLS:
-------------------
✓ Advanced Java Programming
✓ Object-Oriented Design & Analysis
✓ GUI Development (Custom Framework)
✓ Game Logic Programming
✓ Design Pattern Implementation
✓ Event-Driven Programming
✓ File I/O and Resource Management
✓ Algorithm Design (AI player logic)
✓ Software Architecture
✓ Project Organization & Documentation

POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS:
----------------------
• Network multiplayer support
• Game statistics and scoring system
• Multiple difficulty levels for AI
• Sound effects and animations
• Tournament mode
• Customizable rules and variations
• Save/load game functionality

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
--------------------
This project showcases a methodical approach to software development:
1. Requirements analysis and game rule implementation
2. Architecture design with extensibility in mind
3. Incremental development with testing at each stage
4. Code refactoring for maintainability
5. Documentation and code organization

The UNO Game project demonstrates proficiency in Java development, 
software architecture, and the ability to create complex, interactive 
applications from scratch. It represents a complete software solution 
with custom framework development, game logic implementation, and 
user interface design.
