Doxa AI Agent
An intelligent support ticket management system and AI agent designed to automate and streamline regulatory and operational inquiries using RAG.

Tech Stack:
- Next.js 16.1 (App Router)
- FastAPI / Python
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- ChromaDB (Vector Search)
- Mistral AI Integration
- JWT Authentication

Project Description:
This project showcases a complete full-stack architecture featuring an AI-driven orchestration engine. It automates the processing of user tickets and support requests by analyzing regulatory documents (DOXA) and generating intelligent, context-aware responses. The system includes a robust FastAPI backend and a high-performance Next.js 16 frontend for both users and administrators.

Key Features:
- ✓ AI-Orchestrated Pipeline: Multi-step request processing (Precheck, PII Detection, RAG Search).
- ✓ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Uses ChromaDB to search through indexed DOXA documentation for accurate, policy-based answers.
- ✓ Intelligent Feedback Evaluation: Deterministic confidence scoring to automatically respond or escalate to human agents.
- ✓ Advanced Security: Secure JWT authentication with regex-based PII (Personally Identifiable Information) scanning before any LLM interaction.
- ✓ Granular Role System: Comprehensive access control with 4 distinct roles (Admin, Agents, and tiered Clients).
- ✓ Admin Dashboard: Real-time management of tickets, users, and automated response quality tracking.
- ✓ Automated Email Notifications: Integrated SMTP service for real-time status updates via email.
- ✓ Resilient Architecture: Implemented Circuit Breakers and structured logging for production-grade reliability.

Project Highlights:

🔒 AI PII Protection
Advanced security layer that scans and masks sensitive user data (like credit card numbers or contact info) before sending queries to LLMs.

🤖 RAG Orchestration
Sophisticated AI agent pipeline that ingests complex PDF documentation (DOXA) to provide legally and procedurally accurate answers to user requests.

📊 Automated Escalation
Intelligent "Confidence Thresholds" that detect when a request is too complex for AI and automatically assign it to a human agent.

⚡ Modern Performance
Built with the latest Next.js 16 and Tailwind CSS 4, ensuring sub-second page loads and a fully responsive mobile interface.

🏗️ Clean Architecture
Decoupled system design separating Python-based AI services, a RESTful API backend, and a reactive TypeScript frontend.
