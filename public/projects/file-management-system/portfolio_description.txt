                    SECONDARY MEMORY FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
                              Portfolio Project Description
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
A comprehensive secondary memory management system that simulates file storage 
and manipulation operations in C. This project demonstrates advanced understanding 
of data structures, memory allocation, and file system concepts through a complete 
implementation of file management operations.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Programming Language: C
- Concepts: Data Structures, Memory Management, File Systems
- Tools: GCC Compiler, Console Interface

KEY FEATURES:
✓ Dynamic Memory Management
  - Custom memory allocation with configurable block sizes
  - Allocation table management for tracking memory usage
  - Robust error handling and memory cleanup

✓ Multiple File Organization Strategies
  - Global Organization: Contiguous vs. Linked allocation
  - Internal Organization: Sorted vs. Non-sorted records
  - Flexible file creation with user-defined parameters

✓ Complete CRUD Operations
  - Create: File creation with metadata management
  - Read: Fast record search and retrieval algorithms
  - Update: Record insertion with automatic positioning
  - Delete: Both logical (tombstone) and physical deletion

✓ Advanced Memory Operations
  - Memory compaction to eliminate fragmentation
  - File defragmentation to optimize storage
  - Complete file removal with block deallocation
  - File renaming with metadata updates

✓ Interactive User Interface
  - Menu-driven console application
  - Colored output formatting for better user experience
  - Comprehensive error reporting and validation
  - Real-time memory visualization

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Data Structures:
- Record: Basic unit of data storage with ID and deletion flag
- Block: Container for multiple records with linking capabilities
- Metadata: File information including organization type and location
- Memoiresecondaire: Main structure managing the entire file system

Core Algorithms:
- Block allocation strategies (contiguous vs. linked)
- Record insertion with sorted/unsorted organization
- Memory compaction algorithm for fragmentation handling
- Search algorithms optimized for different organizations

Memory Management:
- Dynamic allocation with proper error handling
- Allocation table for efficient space tracking
- Automatic cleanup and memory deallocation
- Fragmentation detection and resolution

FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES:

1. System Initialization
   - Configurable memory size and block factors
   - Dynamic allocation table creation
   - Metadata structure initialization

2. File Management
   - Create files with custom organization strategies
   - Display allocation tables and metadata
   - Rename and delete files with proper cleanup

3. Record Operations
   - Insert records with automatic positioning
   - Search records with efficient algorithms
   - Logical deletion with tombstone marking
   - Physical deletion with memory reclamation

4. Memory Optimization
   - Defragment individual files
   - Compact entire memory system
   - Clear all memory contents

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Low-level memory management in C programming
- Complex data structure design and implementation
- File system concepts and storage optimization techniques
- Algorithm design for search and storage operations
- System programming best practices and error handling
